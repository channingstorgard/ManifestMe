ManifestMe - Manifest Your Desires into Reality

ManifestMe is a personal manifestation app designed to help you turn your dreams into reality by writing them as if they have already happened. Through the power of intention and reflection, you’ll cultivate a mindset that welcomes positive experiences and growth into your life.

Features

1. Daily Event Entries
ManifestMe allows you to jot down up to 15 events a day, written in past tense, as though they have already occurred. Whether it's a simple pleasure like "I got a free coffee today" or a larger life goal, you’re encouraged to articulate it as if it's already part of your story.

2. Seed Your Desires
Once an event is submitted, it's like planting a seed. Let it grow in the background as you move forward in your day-to-day life. Entries are hidden from view for a week, allowing you to manifest without constantly revisiting your list.

3. Progress Tracking
Check back after a week to review and mark which events have come to fruition. You’ll see a Success Rate based on the number of occurrences you’ve marked, as well as your current streak of manifesting your desires. The app tracks your success over time, helping you stay motivated.

4. Daily Reminders
ManifestMe offers an Enable Daily Reminder feature to keep you on track with your daily manifestation entries, ensuring you stay consistent in this practice.

How to Use

Submit Entries: Write about events or experiences as though they have already happened. Keep it positive and in the past tense (e.g., "I received an unexpected compliment").
Review Your Entries: After a week, revisit your previous entries in the Review section. Mark the ones that have occurred and reflect on the progress you’ve made.
Track Your Success: View your overall Success Rate and current manifestation streak in the Progress section to stay motivated in your journey.
Why ManifestMe?

ManifestMe is designed to help users shift their mindset from focusing on what they don’t have, to embracing what’s already on its way to them. The simple act of writing positive intentions daily can help foster a mindset of abundance and gratitude, while the delayed review process encourages reflection and self-growth.
